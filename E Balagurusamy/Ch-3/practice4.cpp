/*
Write a program to evaluate the following investment equation
V = p(1 + r)^n
and print the table which would give the value of V for various combination of the following values of p,r and n.

p: 1000,2000,3000,....,10000
r: 0.10,0.11,0.12,....,0.20
n: 1,2,3,....,10

Hint : p is the principle amount and V is the value of money at the end of n years. This equation can be recursively written as : 
V = p(1 + r)
p = V
IN other words,the value of money at the end of the first year becomes the principle amount for the next year, and so on.
